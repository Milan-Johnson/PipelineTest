# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
 

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code (main branch)
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0  # To allow switching branches later

    - name: Checkout config files from config branch
      run: |
        git fetch origin config
        git checkout origin/config -- path/to/config-files/
      # Replace path/to/config-files with the directory in config branch

    - name: List config files
      run: ls -la path/to/config-files/

    # Placeholder for build or deploy logic
    - name: Run your app logic
      run: echo "Run tests, build, or deploy"

    # Later stage: Fetch from AWS SSM
    - name: Fetch secrets from AWS SSM (example)
      env:
        AWS_REGION: us-east-1
      run: |
        PARAM=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/your/param/path" --with-decryption --query "Parameter.Value" --output text)
        echo "Param: $PARAM"
      # Requires AWS credentials set up (see below)
